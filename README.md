# Predicting Restaurant Ratings with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts restaurant aggregate ratings based on various features such as location, cuisine, price range and other restaurant attributes. By analysing the dataset and training predictive models, the project demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow: from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Project Workflow

- Data Preparation – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding feature distributions, correlations, and insights.

- Modeling – Training multiple models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and others.

- Evaluation – Comparing models using accuracy, RMSE, and other metrics.

- Conclusions – Identifying the best-performing model for restaurant rating prediction.


## Results

The notebook evaluates several machine learning algorithms and provides insights into which model performs best at predicting restaurant ratings.

Key findings and visualisations are included within the notebook.


## Future Work

Experiment with more advanced models such as XGBoost or Neural Networks.

Perform hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.

Deploy the best model as an API or web app for real-time restaurant rating predictions.
